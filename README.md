Hoagie In One is a console based sandwich shop application built to streamline the sandwich making process. We have the ability to add a multitude of toppings, add drinks, chips, extra toppings, and provide accurate receipts (in case we have to do a refund!) 

When we think of delicious sandwiches, the first thought that comes to mind is the Krusty Krab! (Hence, the influence.) Here is a screenshot from our main selections screen:

When the wrong input is generated, spongebob has something very special to say.
